Re-connecting Network Sites

Consider the problem of selecting a set T of high-speed lines for connecting N network sites, from a universe of M high-speed lines each connecting a pair of network sites. Each high-speed line has a given monthly cost, and the objective is tominimize the total cost of connecting the N network sites, where thetotal cost is the sum of the cost of each line included in set T.

Consider further that this problem has been solved earlier for the set of N network sites and M high-speedlines, but that a few K new high-speed lines have recently become available.  Your objective is to computethe new set T2 that may yield a costlower than the original set T, due to the additional K newhigh-speed lines and when M + K high-speed lines are available.

 

 Input

 First line of input contains the value indicating number of test cases.  Thenseveral test cases follow starting from next line, each of them as describedbelow.

 The input is organized as follows:

 *)  A line containing the number N of network sites, with 1 <=  N<= 1000000, and where each network site is referred by a number i, 1 <= i <= N.


 *)  The set T of previously chosen high-speed lines, consisting of N - 1 lines, each describing a high-speedline, and containing the numbers of the two network sites the line connects and the monthly cost of using this line. All costs are integers.


 *)  A line containing the number K of new additional lines, 1 <= K <= 10.


 *)  K lines,each describing a new high-speed line, and containing the numbers of the two networksites the line connects and the monthly cost of using this line. All costs are integers.


 *)  A line containing the number Mof originally available high-speed lines, with N – 1 <=  M <= N(N - 1)/2.


 *) M lines,each describing one of the originally available high-speed lines, and containing the numbers of the two network sites the line connects and the monthly cost of using this line. All costs are integers.

 Output

 For each test case, the output must followthe description below. The first line for each test case output is “Case #tn”,where tn is the test case number.

 The next line of each test case contains the first number indicating original cost of connecting the N network sites with M high-speedlines and another number containing the new cost of connecting the N networksites  with M +K high-speedlines.
